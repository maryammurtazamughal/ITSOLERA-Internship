# CV Parsing Using OCR

This project implements a CV (Curriculum Vitae) parsing system that extracts and analyzes text from CVs using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
It leverages libraries such as Tesseract OCR and spaCy to process documents and extract structured information.


## Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
* Tesseract OCR
* Libraries: pytesseract, python-docx, pdf2image, spacy, re, opencv-python


## Format
The project processes CVs in various formats. It supports extracting text from:
* PDF files: system should handle both scanned PDFs (using OCR to extract text) and text-based PDFs (directly extracting text without OCR).
* DOCX files
* DOC files


## Spacy
* Text Analysis: Apply NLP technique to extract and categorize information (e.g., contact details, skills, experience).
